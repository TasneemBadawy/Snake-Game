# Snake Game in C++

## Description 

This is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C++. In this project, I built a classic snake game from scratch, which deepened my understanding of fundamental C++ concepts such as functions, arrays, and real-time input handling. The game features a snake that grows longer as it eats randomly placed fruits, while the game terminates if the snake hits the wall or collides with its own tail.

## Features
-**Real-Time Gameplay:**
The snake moves continuously across a grid rendered in the console.

-**Fruit Consumption:**
The snake consumes fruits that appears at random positions. Eating a fruit increases the score and the snake's length.

-**Collision Detection:**
The game ends if the snake hits the boundary of the playing field or collides with itself.

-**Console Visuals:**
Utilizes `conio.h` for capturing real-time keyboard input (W, A, S, D for movement; X to exit).

## Requirements

- A C++ compiller (e.g.,Visual Studio , Code Blocks)
- Windows operating system (due to Windows-specific libraries like `windows.h` and `conio.h`)
